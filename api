Project name: One-Stop Career Advisor — Frontend

Goal:
Build a responsive, accessible React + TypeScript frontend for a student-facing web app. It must implement:
- User authentication (sign up / login) with email + password (JWT-based backend assumed).
- Student dashboard with profile summary and progress.
- A multi-step interactive aptitude/interest test (quiz) that collects answers and stores progress locally while online/offline.
- Submission of quiz results to a recommendation API endpoint and display of returned recommendations (courses, colleges, scholarships, loans, higher studies).
- Simple admin view stub (read-only) for testing content updates.
- Mobile-first UI and internationalization-ready strings (English as default).

Tech stack & constraints:
- React (v18+) with TypeScript.
- Use functional components + hooks.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (no other CSS frameworks).
- Routing: React Router.
- Form handling: react-hook-form + yup validation.
- State: React Context for auth + lightweight local store; use localStorage/IndexedDB (or localForage) for offline quiz progress.
- No back-end implementation required — use the API endpoint placeholders below.
- Provide a README with start/build/test commands.
- Provide example unit tests (Jest + React Testing Library) for 2 components.
- Provide clear file tree and implemented sample files: App.tsx, main routes, Auth context, Dashboard page, Quiz page, Recommendations page, a reusable Card component, and API service wrapper.

Pages & behavior (exact):
1. Landing page (/)
   - Short app description and CTA: Sign Up / Login.

2. Auth pages (/auth/register, /auth/login)
   - Register collects: name, email, phone (optional), password, preferred language.
   - Login returns JWT (simulate by storing a dummy token if backend unreachable).
   - After login, redirect to /dashboard.

3. Dashboard (/dashboard)
   - Shows: student name, profile completeness % (based on fields filled), last quiz date, quick CTA to “Take Quiz” or “Continue Quiz”.
   - Small widget showing top 1 recommended career (if available).
   - Button to open Quiz, and link to Recommendations history.

4. Quiz (/quiz)
   - Multi-step quiz with progress bar.
   - Each step shows 1–3 questions (MCQ with scores).
   - Save progress locally after each step; allow “Resume later”.
   - On final submit, POST quiz results to POST /api/quiz/submit and show loading + success state.
   - If offline, store submission attempt and retry when online.

5. Recommendations (/recommendations and /recommendations/:id)
   - After successful quiz submit, show cards for top recommended streams/courses.
   - Each card displays: course name, confidence score, short explanation, suggested local colleges (name + distance), scholarships (title + brief), and suggested next actions (apply, view college).
   - A “Send to Email” and “Save to Profile” button (simulate behavior).

6. Colleges (/colleges)
   - List of nearby colleges returned from GET /api/colleges?lat=&lng=&radius=
   - Map integration optional: show a small static map stub or embed (but provide component to add map later).

7. Notifications (/notifications)
   - Simple list of timeline items (admissions, scholarships, exams). Load from GET /api/notifications/:user_id.

8. Admin stub (/admin)
   - Read-only list of colleges and quiz questions (for demo).

API endpoints (frontend should call these; if backend not available, mock them with local JSON):
- POST /api/auth/register -> { user: {id,name,email,language}, token }
- POST /api/auth/login -> { user, token }
- GET /api/user/profile -> { user_profile }
- PUT /api/user/profile -> updated profile
- GET /api/quiz/questions -> returns array of questions (example JSON below)
- POST /api/quiz/submit -> { recommendations: [...] }
- GET /api/recommendations/:student_id -> list
- GET /api/colleges?lat=&lng=&radius= -> list of college objects
- GET /api/notifications/:user_id -> list

Example quiz question JSON (use this format to build UI):
{
  "id": 1,
  "question": "Do you enjoy solving math problems?",
  "type": "single-choice",
  "options": [
    { "id": "a", "text": "Always", "score": 3 },
    { "id": "b", "text": "Sometimes", "score": 2 },
    { "id": "c", "text": "Rarely", "score": 1 }
  ],
  "category": "quantitative"
}

Example POST /api/quiz/submit input:
{
  "user_id": 101,
  "answers": [
    { "question_id": 1, "option_id": "a" },
    { "question_id": 2, "option_id": "b" }
  ],
  "metadata": { "device": "web", "lang": "en" }
}

Example /api/quiz/submit response:
{
  "student_id": 101,
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "id": "rec1",
      "course": "B.Sc. Mathematics",
      "confidence": 0.86,
      "explanation": "High quantitative score and interest in problem solving.",
      "careers": ["Data Analyst", "Research Assistant"],
      "suggested_colleges": [
         { "id": 1, "name": "Govt Degree College A", "distance_km": 6 }
      ],
      "scholarships": [
         { "id": "sch1", "title": "State Merit Scholarship", "link": "#" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Non-functional requirements:
- Mobile-first, responsive, 320px to 1280px.
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation, aria labels on interactive elements, alt text on images, focus indicators.
- Internationalization: wrap visible strings for easy i18n.
- Offline resilience: store quiz progress locally and retry submission when network returns.
- Error handling: show user-friendly errors and retry buttons for failed API calls.

Deliverables (explicit):
1. Full React project scaffold (file tree + implemented files).
2. Implemented pages/components listed above with working navigation and simulated API integration.
3. README with how to run locally (npm install, npm start) and how to connect real backend endpoints.
4. Two unit tests (one for QuizStepper, one for RecommendationCard).
5. A short demo script describing how to test login -> quiz -> submit -> view recommendations.

Additional instructions for the generator:
- Keep code well-documented and modular.
- Use TypeScript interfaces for API data shapes.
- Use an API service module (api.ts) that centralizes fetch calls and handles token injection.
- Provide mock data fallback when API returns 4xx/5xx or when running in demo mode.
- Do not include any paid or proprietary libraries. Use only open-source packages.

Return format:
- Provide a downloadable code archive or a GitHub-style file tree with file contents for main files.
- If full project is too large for one response, prioritize delivering:
   1) App scaffold (package.json, tailwind config)
   2) Auth context + sample auth pages
   3) Quiz page + QuizStepper component
   4) Recommendations page + RecommendationCard component
   5) API service with mock mode
   6) README
