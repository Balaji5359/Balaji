I am a final-year B Tech student with a strong passion for Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, Data Science and Generative AI. Currently, I am researching Machine Learning and Generative AI, and I enjoy building and deploying projects in the AWS Cloud. I am open to internships to gain practical experience in these domains.
I am looking to secure an internship or full-time role in AWS Cloud and Data Science to apply and expand my skills. I love learning about new technologies, exploring innovative AI and GenAI products, listening to music, and attending conferences and workshops to keep myself updated. I also enjoy spending time with my friends and family.
I have built interactive and innovative projects using Generative AI, React, Python, and Cloud technologies. I have worked on more than 10+ datasets in Kaggle and published my ML models and Dashboard in GitHub using Power Bi, ML and Python Libraries. I have completed training courses in Python, Machine Learning, Data Science, Generative AI, and AWS Cloud Essential, where I focused on building innovative projects. I am a self-motivated, consistent learner with good communication skills, and I am confident working both independently and collaboratively.
